Dynamic Chinese Zodiac Table 

created by Lauren Kwa

Description:

Using javascript to create a dynamic table to display birth years under the corresponding Chinese zodiac sign.

Arrays and for loops were used to create the tables.

Two pages (1D and 2D) were created that use a one-dimensional array and a two-dimensional array respectively.
